# App Template in LESS

This is a nice clean app setup for handling stylesheets. It splits stuff out into a critical payload and a 'base' toolkit that's used throughout the app. 

The critical payload includes normalize, document reset, and font-face imports as well as developer styles.

The base toolkit includes basic mixins, responsive mixins, and other good practices to keep things tidy. It's available to rules in both the critical stylesheets and post-render app stylesheets.
